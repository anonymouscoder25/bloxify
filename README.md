# bloxify
  Bloxify is a plugin for replicating roblox bones/attachments onto custom roblox rigs. This is useful for creating a tower defense game because if you want to ad a six pack to your zombies and animate it like a normal roblox character, you would have to add all the motor6ds and attachments into each part. This plugin handles those scenarios.
